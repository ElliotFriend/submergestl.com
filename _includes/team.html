We want to help students go deeper within their faith and show them what that Journey looks like. We have an amazing speaker and worship leader who are prepared to lead students by interacting and sharing their stories. We hope that through this conference time that they will grasp the concept of the journey and understand what it means to accept the call that God has set before them. We hope you will join us on September 23rd & 24th as we venture into the word. We are also partnering up with LOVEtheLOU again, helping them with their community gardens and other projects they have for us.</p>
